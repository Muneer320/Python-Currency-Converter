# Python-Currency-Converter

It is areally basic currency converter made with python. It basically takes the value of the currency as given in the "CurrencyData.txt" file and use it to show the value of currency that you wanna see.

So its not that accurate because the value of currency is is saved just once but we know that value of currency changes every minute, therefore it's not that accurate but still it will give you a very good round-off result.
